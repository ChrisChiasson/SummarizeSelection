# Privacy Policy for Summarize Selection in OpenAI ChatGPT

Summarize selected text in OpenAI ChatGPT. This is useful to save time with articles and documentation. I am not affiliated with OpenAI. You must be logged in to ChatGPT.

## Privacy Policy

I respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information I collect from you and how I use it.

### Information I Collect

Currently, I do not collect any information, period. Not even basic analytics, anonymized usage, or IP addresses.

Note that if you file an issue on Github, since it is a public website, people will see what you post. I have no control over this.

### How We Use Your Information

I do not use your information because I do not collect it.

### Your Choices

You do not have to opt out, because I don't collect anything, so there isn't anything to opt out of.

### Changes to This Policy

If the policy of not taking any data ever changes, I will update this privacy policy, increase the major (leading) version number of the extension, and provide notice on the extension page in the Chrome Extension site.

### Contact Me

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please file an issue in this GitHub repository.
